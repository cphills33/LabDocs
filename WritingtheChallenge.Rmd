## What is the Challenge
> - The challenge is where you describe the knowledge you hope to gain
> - In journal articles, the challenge comes at the end of the introduction
> - In grants, the challenge comes at the beginning
> - **The knowledge you hope to gain is the core of the paper. Nailing this down will guide you in writing the rest of the paper**


## Parts of the Challenge
> - What do you want to learn?
> - How are you going to learn it?
> - What do you think will happen?
> - Sometimes you might have objectives instead of hypotheses. But usually you want to write your objectives as though they are hypotheses because they probably are. Sometimes you have hypotheses and objectives. That's ok, all these rules can be broken.

## What do you want to learn
- All challenges need to communicate this:
    - **To learn x, we did y**
- What you want to learn is **x**
- Bad challenges focus on *information* rather than *knowledge*
- Bad challenges focus on *results* rather than their *meaning*

## What do you want to learn (examples)
> - how facial expressions moderate prejudice (good)
> - how favorable participants felt toward people displaying angry, neutral, and happy facial expressions. (bad--but good for another part of the challenge)
> - how men and women are represented in the cognitive schemas of social categories around the world (to learn x)
> - how strongly prejudice against the men and women of social categories was related to prejudice against those categories overall (we did y)

## How are you going to learn it?
- To learn x, we did y
- How you are going to do it is **y**
- A 1 or 2 sentence summary of your methods

## How are you going to learn it? (tips)
- We investigated ...
- We examined ...
- We manipulated ...
- We compared ... 
- We conducted an experiment in which ...
- We tested ...

## How are you going to learn it? (examples)
> - We examined how favorable participants felt toward people displaying angry, neutral, and happy facial expressions.
> - We compared how strongly prejudice against the men and women of social categories was related to prejudice against those categories overall

## Have you forgotten anything?
- All the main 'characters' of your 'story' should be included in the: to learn x, we did y statements
- 'Characters' are the variables of your study. 
    - Someone else should be able to determine the relationship between your main variables by reading the: to learn x, we did y statement
    - Which variables are the IVs?
    - Which variables are the DVs?
    - Or are you making an association claim instead of a causal claim?

## What do you think will happen?
- Your hypotheses or predictions
    - We predict
    - We expect
    - We hypothesize

## What do you think will happen?
- We expected the least amount of prejudice against target category members displaying an emotional facial expression and the greatest amount of prejudice against target category members displaying a neutral facial expression. 

## What do you think will happen?
- We predicted that for some categories (e.g., ) prejudice against men would be more strongly related to prejudice against the group than prejudice against women. For other categories (e.g., ), we predicted the opposite. Conducting this experiment in many regions of the world (e.g., Africa, Asia, Middle East, Central America and Mexico, USA and Canada, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Scandinavia, South America, UK) allowed us to predict that for a third group of categories (e.g., ) prejudice against men would be more strongly related to prejudice against the group in some regions but the opposite would be true in other regions. For example, in the USA and Canada we predicted that prejudice against East Asian women would be more strongly related to prejudice against East Asians as a group than prejudice against East Asian men but in Asia we predicted the opposite. 

## The title
- The is one of the most important parts of the paper
    - Because it is the most read part
    - So is the abstract
- Spend some time getting the title right. It should describe the challenge to the reader
    - This means it must introduce all the 'characters' and their relationships
