## R (Analysis Tool 1)
<div class="columns-2">
According to  [r4stats:](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)

<div class="notes">
In this course, we will be using one of the most popular statistical analysis programs: R

Courtesy of this website (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., R was the second most popular statistical analysis program used in scholarly articles in 2016.

The long-term trend is for R to become the most popular statistical analysis program.

You can see SPSS was by far the most popular, but its popularity has really decreased. SAS's popularity has also decreased.

10 years from now I expect R to be the most popular stats program among psychologists. That means if you learn it now, you will have a marketable skill going forward. Lots of research laboratories will be looking to start analyzing their data in R and they will want to work with people like you who have experience with it (or you will, starting today!).
</div>

## RStudio
- We won't work directly with the R GUI. Instead, we will work with R Studio.
- RStudio provides many, many helpful functions and features
    - These slides were created with RStudio!
    - You can write papers that conform to APA style with RStudio
    - You can make pretty graphs with RStudio
    - You can make shareable output with RStudio
- But why do any of these things with RStudio?

## Reproducible Science
> - **Replication:** Using new data, can you replicate a previous finding?

> - **Reproducibility:** Using the same data, can you get the same results?

>- What are some reasons for reproducibility errors?

## Statcheck (Analysis Tool 2)
- <statcheck.io>
- Checks your p's, F's, t's, and df's
- Statcheck is right about [95% of the time](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/controversial-software-proving-surprisingly-accurate-spotting-errors-psychology-papers)
- Statcheck checked 30 000 papers and found about [half contain at least one error](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-015-0664-2).

## The GRIM Test
- [The GRIM Test: A Simple Technique Detects Numerous Anomalies in the Reporting of Results in Psychology](http://sci-hub.tw/http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616673876)
- Granularity-related inconsistency of means
- Look at the sample size, look at the means. Are the means even possible?
- Half of studies between 2011-2015 with Likert scales failed the GRIM test in the following journals:
    - Psychological Science (PS)
    - Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (JEP:G)
    - Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP)
    
## Papaja (Writing Tool 1)
- <https://github.com/crsh/papaja> 
- Works with RStudio to create APA style consistent manuscripts
- Never make a reproducibility mistake again!
    - Put your analysis script right in the manuscript!
    - Put the code to create your graphs, right in the manuscript
    - Never mess around with headers and footers again
    - Automatically create reference pages that update as you make changes
    
## Zotero (Writing Tool 2)
- <https://www.zotero.org>
- A reference manager
- Other options include mendeley or endnotes or refworks
- We will use zotero for this course because it integrates with RStudio and is free

## Grammarly (Writing Tool 3)
- <https://www.grammarly.com>
- Check spelling and basic grammar
    - Excellent at catching passive voice
    - Let's you know when you're being too wordy
    - Not perfect but useful. It's like a fresh set of eyes.
- I use it for all my writing

## 2019 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program
- <https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/Login.do> 
- <https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm>
- 3 years of support at approximately $42 000 per year
- The Personal Statement, Previous Research Experience, and Proposed Plan of Research essays each have a maximum length of two pages, including all references, citations, charts, figures, images, and lists of publications and presentations. 
- Due last of week of October
- **We will work on these essays as part of this class. You decide whether you want to submit**

## The **challenge** of every thesis, article, and grant proposal
> - This is where you communicate the contribution of your work 
> - What do you want to learn?
> - How are you going to learn it?
> - What do you think will happen?
> - Sometimes you might have objectives instead of hypotheses. But usually you want to write your objectives as though they are hypotheses because they probably are. Sometimes you have hypotheses and objectives. That's ok, all these rules can be broken.

## What do you want to learn
- To learn x, we did y
- Bad challenges focus on information rather than knowledge
- Bad challenges focus on results rather than the meaning of results

## What do you want to learn (examples)
> - how facial expressions moderate prejudice
> - how favorable participants felt toward people displaying angry, neutral, and happy facial expressions.
> - how men and women are represented in the cognitive schemas of social categories around the world (to learn x)
> - how strongly prejudice against the men and women of social categories were related to prejudice against those categories overall (we did y)

## Writing Strategy
- Get your idea onto the screen
- Then check out these tips to make your writing more powerful

## Tips for writing sentences (1)
> - Subject, verb, object
> - Who is the sentence about? 
> - What happened?
> - What was the outcome?  
> - Put the verb and subject as close together as possible
> - The ice cream melted.
> - The ice cream, which was strawberry, melted.
> - Can you make this sentence more powerful without losing information?

## Tips for writing sentences (2)
> - **Topic**: the beginning of the sentence. Put old information here
> - **Stress**: the end of the sentence. Put new information here. This holds the emotional weight of the sentence.
> - In a multi-clause sentence, the ending of each clause is a *stress*.
> - **Topic is second most important**. It should be short and clear. Main verb should immediately follow topic.
> - **Middle is least important**. Put things that you don't want emphasized here. (or don't have this)
> - **Stress is most important**. Put your key message here. Delete words that follow the word you want to be the stress.
> - The strawberry ice cream melted on the table.

## Tips for writing sentences (3)
> - What is the topic and what is the stress? What is the story?
> - Viruses were not studied in the sea until 1989 yet are its most abundant biological entities.
> - The most abundant biological entities in the sea are viruses, yet they were not studied until 1989.
> - The most abundant biological entities in the sea were not studied until 1989: viruses.
> - The placement of 'viruses', '1989', and 'most abundant biological entities in the sea' can tell up to six different stories
> - Think about the story you are telling with each sentence you write

## Tips for writing sentences (4)
> - What is the topic of your sentence???
> - Is it you? Is that what you intend?
> - Is it the authors of a paper? Smith (2001) found X.
> - They should never be the topic of a sentence. X (Smith, 2001).
> - Are you using filter phrases? There is evidence that X (Smith, 2001)
> - Delete filter phrases! X (Smith, 2001)

## Tips for writing sentences (5)
> - Avoid adverbs. Just use a stronger or weaker noun or verb.
> - There can be exceptions but these adverbs are bad.
> - Significant(ly), certain(ly), entire(ly), high(ly), quite, rather, real(ly), simple(ly), substantial(ly), very
> - The immune system uses a highly effective control mechanism that efficiently discriminates between self and nonself.
